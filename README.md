# StorageOccupationStatistics
 C# code with GUI to visualize a storage device's statistics with heirarchical view of folders and their occupation.

 The GUI is winforms, you have to set the path from the program, there is no "Loading" so you will have to wait for everything to populate.
 
 This is supposed to mimic the design of ubuntu file statistics program.

 It is to help discover files that are taking a large space on the system (and are have been forgotten, or not noticed). After that the use can delete the files he thinks are not 
 needed later (deleting a file is not currently a feature in the program).

### Future
* Usage of a better GUI
* Adding folder choosing feature
* Adding some sort of loading screen, to show that the program is working in the background
